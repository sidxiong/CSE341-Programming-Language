# CSE341-Programming-Language
## Overview
CSE341 of University of Washington, also the Programming Languages (A, B, C) on Coursera.

A quote from the course syllabus:

> A course titled, Programming Languages” can mean many different things. For us, it means the opportunity to learn the **fundamental concepts** that appear in one form or another in almost every programming language. We will also get some sense of how these concepts “fit together” to **provide what programmers need** in a language. And we will use different languages to see how they can take complementary approaches to representing these concepts. 
> 
> All of this is intended to make you a better software developer, in any language.
